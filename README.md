# Project 1
This site was created for my GitHub Pages Portfolio Assignment as part of the MIT xPro – Professional Certificate in Coding: Women’s Cohort. This includes a landing page with information about myself and a projects page to showcase three projects I have completed so far in this course.

## How to Run
To run this site, simply visit the page using a web browser.

## RoadMap of Future Improvements
This project was completed as part of the MIT xPro – Professional Certificate in Coding: Women’s Cohort. As the course continues I will likely add more projects and update the code to showcase my growing skills.
